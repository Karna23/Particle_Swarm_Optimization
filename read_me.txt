This is an Optimisation problem where you need to find the global minima of the
given objective function using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) technique. PSO
solves an optimisation problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here
dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to
simple mathematical formulae over the particle’s position and velocity. Each particle’s
movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward
the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are
found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
The goal is to find a solution a for which f(a)  f(b) for all b in the search-space,
which would mean a is the global minimum.
